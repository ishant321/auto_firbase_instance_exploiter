### How to use autofirebase.sh

-> Download "autofirebase.sh" file.<br/>
-> Create a folder "apkfiles".<br/>
-> Put all your apk files inside that folder.<br/>
-> Make sure that the "autofirebase.sh" file and "apkfiles" folder must be in same directory.<br/>
-> Then run the file using the command "sh ./autofirebase.sh".<br/>
-> The output will be printed in green colour and the firebase instance url is also printed.<br/>

### Working of the tool
This tool takes a set of android apk files as input and if the application uses firebase instance then it will 
provide you the firebase instance URL and the response of it.
